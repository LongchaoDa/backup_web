##### Python




# define your input data as a tf.data.Dataset object
data = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices((x_train, y_train))
data = data.shuffle(buffer_size=10000)
data = data.batch(batch_size)

# define your model using the eager execution API
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(input_size,)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

# define your loss function and optimizer
loss_fn = tf.keras.losses.SparseCategoricalCrossentropy()
optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam()

# train the model using eager execution


#### Code Explanation

This is the code to help you understand an example of how to use the tf.data API to create an input pipeline for a simple model:
